# Bevy Player Move

If you're learning, make sure to check out the commit history.

The lld setup for *blazingly* fast compile times (0.1s-2s) was extracted from [Bevy's Get Started Guide](https://bevyengine.org/learn/book/getting-started/setup/#create-a-new-bevy-project).

The texture atlas loading strategy and animation logic was extracted from [bevy_asset_loader's atlas from grid example](https://github.com/NiklasEi/bevy_asset_loader/blob/main/bevy_asset_loader/examples/atlas_from_grid.rs)

The rest is just a very basic state machine.
